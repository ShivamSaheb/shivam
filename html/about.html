                If I told you that I am a cause-based person, I wouldn't be lying. Much of the work I have done and continue to do is in
                the hope that I will one day have contributed to shaping the future. There have been several moments in my
                life where I might have stopped to consider the long term implications of my work; I might have decided to
                take a step back or in a new direction, but these many moments have come as a collective to define my experience,
                destination, and character.

            <p id="aboutparas" style="font-size:15px">
                On this site you will find several pieces of those works. They range from my engineering background to my musical interests.
                It is my hope that by seeing them, you discover something unique and, perhaps, become a bit more enlightened
                as to who I really am.

                Being an engineering student, I have very little spare time. My current endeavours involve me using theoretical knowledge
                that I have gained in my coursework to develop AI machines. I am investing time into learning skills in this
                field as I believe it is what will power systems of tomorrow.
            </p>
            <p id="aboutparas">
                A project that I have recently begun is an AI drone (ADRONEI) which is being designed to detect obstacles around it such
                that it is able to navigate around them and prevent an accident. If successful, the knowledge I will have
                gained in this project will enable me to develop better crash prevention systems which are vital to the success
                of autonomous vehicles.

                I have a couple of long term plans which need to be thought through before I can make them public. These plans consist of
                projects that I believe will focus largely on AI, programming, and manufacturing. In doing this, I am hoping
                to gain some practical experience.
            </p>
            <p id="aboutparas">
                I plan on having the drone design ready by the end of this year. This will include a complete plan of its capabilities, CAD
                designs, components that I will require, and an overall schedule for development.
            </p>
            <p id="aboutparas">
                Simultaneously, I will be completing my final year of engineering after which I might take some time off to travel.

                Perhaps having a broader sense of the world will also broaden my sense for creative design.
